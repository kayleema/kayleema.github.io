Cute SciFi. Fun easy read though the protagonist is annoying sometimes.

I largely enjoyed it, though I was a little disappointed that it felt like the writing/characters were too simple sometimes. Though a lot of the protagonist, 暦’s actions made me roll my eyes, some events to come later actually made me pretty emotional. It feels like a light novel although it's technically a novel.

This is the first novel I’ve read where I really felt like I didn’t need a dictionary and could read at full speed, so I’m looking forward to getting to the level where I can read more difficult novels with this level of fluency.

Though the story is very conspicuously science fiction I didn't think the technobabble was too bad if you have solid kanji knowledge at this level. It has fewer furigana than novels at a similar level, but not so much that it would be disruptive to an experienced reader at this level.
