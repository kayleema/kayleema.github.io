Materials
---------
* [Pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EWENMAU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Temperature Controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y8T9YZG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Heating Element](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M0Q84BR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Bucket --- big enough to hold everything
* Small Basket --- to separate the heating coil from the bottles of chemicals.
* Power cable to hack --- You can use any standard power cable that plugs into the wall. I used the wall side of a broken apple power adaptor.

Tools
-----
* Wire Strippers / Knife
* Tape

Wiring
------
![wiring diagram](/images/bathwiring.png)

Wire the pieces together as shown. You will need an additional piece of wire for the middle red connection, but you can also cut this from the power cable. 

Small Scale Test
----------------
You should now be able to test the setup by inserting the temperature sensor and heating element in a small cup of water and setting the controller to a temperature following the instructions that come with the temperature controller. At this point you should be able to observe the system keeping the water at a stable temperature.
