*a.k.a Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu*

**【Review from a Japanese language learning perspective】**

I've heard it said that this is the best book in the series, and I can see why. The story is gripping and the writing is
engaging. It makes sense that this is the book that was adapted to a movie. This volume is shorter than the others and
is one continuous story making it less episodic than the others.

In the end, I was surprised to find myself reflecting how the ideas of the story apply to my life. I've often thought
about how I'd do things differently if I could go back in time and how much easier my life would be if I had done some
things differently in my childhood. I've even thought about what I could do if I went back in time and could give myself
some crucial information that would have changed my life for the better. But the story made me think about how the life
I've lived has been so much more "interesting" and unusual than the life I could have had without the difficulties I've
been through.
