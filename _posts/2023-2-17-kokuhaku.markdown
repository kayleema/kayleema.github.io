*a.k.a Kokuhaku*

It was an easier read than I expected. I'm not sure if the first chapter is truly difficult or just intimidating as it is a stream of consciousness with few paragraph breaks. As others have noted, after the first chapter, it gets easier. During the second chapter in particular, I felt like I was flying through the pages. 

Captivating from start to finish.
