*a.k.a. Conbini Ningen*

I didn't really find the story very interesting for some reason. Some parts were kind of depressing, but maybe that's just my tendency to be anxious and existential. None of the characters seemed very likable to me though it was fun to laugh at 白羽さん's ridiculous antics.

This book might be a good fit for someone who is more interested in grounded contemporary human stories as opposed to something more fantastical or thrilling. It's a quite short book---even if it didn't end up being such a "page-turner" for me.
