**【Review from a Japanese language learning perspective】**

Not bad, but hard for me to get through

The main girl in the story embodies the trope of the "manic pixie dream girl" more than I expected and maybe that's why 
I feel like the story felt a little shallow and predictable at times.

I found the story a little hard to get through. Perhaps it was for the story reasons above, but it may also be due to 
some long sentences, or the standoffish attitude of the protagonist which made it difficult to follow his thoughts. The 
story was also a little more introspective than I prefer.

There is also an anime and live-action movie adaptation of this novel. This is a rare case in which I recommend the 
live-action as a better adaptation than the anime. The anime is a straightforward adaptation while the drama adds some 
more compelling storylines original to the movie and has better acting in my opinion.
