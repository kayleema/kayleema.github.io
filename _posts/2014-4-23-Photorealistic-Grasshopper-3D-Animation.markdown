I modeled, textured and rigged a locust/grasshopper in blender.  Here's my first attempt at animating it:

<br/>
Next, I tracked a simple video I took on my phone, and then composited the locust into the scene.

Here's another more complicated video where I had to match some dynamic motion and do some more complicated masking.

I am pretty happy with the results, but there's definitely room for improvement.  For example, you can see the cracks in the glass before the grasshopper hops through it.
