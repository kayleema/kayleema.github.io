*a.k.a Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu*

Despite having the promised aliens, supernaturals, and time travelers, the vocabulary is not so exotic as to not be useful for a Japanese learner. I've been able to learn some good common phrases and idioms from this novel. It is the most challenging novel I've read so far.

It's as fun as I expected from having watched the anime years ago, and being able to read Kyon's internal dialog adds a lot to the experience above what you get in the anime.
Of what has been adapted to anime there is a loose one-to-one mapping from chapter to episode though the later half of the volumes in this series have not been adapted to anime. Hopefully I have time to finish reading the rest some time.
