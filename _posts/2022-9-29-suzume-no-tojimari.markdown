I found this story easier to read than I expected–though I don't have much experience with which to compare. I haven't read any of the other novelizations, but the themes and plot of this story is largely typical of what I have seen in other Makoto Shinkai films. One notable difference though, is that while there is an element of romance, it is less central to the story than other works by Shinkai. I think it was more of an exciting plot than 天気の子 though I don't expect it to be as successful as 君の名は。

The goal of finishing the book before the movie comes out was great motivation for me. The sense of fast pace as the characters travel made it easy to keep reading without getting bored. It was fun to google the music lyrics that were mentioned at various points.
