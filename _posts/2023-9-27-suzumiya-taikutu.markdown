*a.k.a Suzumiya Haruhi no Taikutsu*

**【Review from a Japanese language learning perspective】**

The novel is divided into four largely independent chapters:  涼宮ハルヒの退屈、笹の葉ラプソディ、ミステリックサイン、and 孤島症候群

Apparently these stories were written before the first book of the haruhi series and some of them were serialized at 
that time as well.  As always Kyon's internal dialog includes various references to everything from 
[The Seven Bridges of Königsberg Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_Königsberg), to Saint 
Francis's Preaching to Birds, to [Xu Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Fu)

孤島症候群 is the chapter for which the anime diverges the most from the book. It is also the longest chapter and has two
episodes in the anime adaptation while the other chapters only have one.
