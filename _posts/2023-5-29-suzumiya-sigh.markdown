*a.k.a Suzumiya Haruhi no Tameiki*

**【Review from a Japanese language learning perspective】**

This is the second novel of the Suzumiya Haruhi series. [Click here](/2023/03/23/suzumiya.html) to read my review of the
first novel.

Much of the same as what I expected from reading the first book. There were some interesting references to various
media/history that are confusing, but from the native Japanese speakers I've asked, such references seem to go over
their heads as well.

From my experience watching the anime I was worried that the novel would feel too slow paced as it largely only
covers <Spoiler>the SOS団's production of the movie for the 文化祭</Spoiler> but I found the story to be sufficiently
interesting throughout to keep me interested.

This book is a light novel published by 角川スニーカー文庫, but there is also a 角川文庫 version of the novel that has
slightly larger font and removes illustrations. The 角川文庫 version has largely the same content, but in place of the
author's あとがき there is a cute essay by an idol from 乃木坂46 profoundly discussing what the Suzumiya Haruhi series means
to her.
