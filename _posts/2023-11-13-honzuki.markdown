**【Review from a Japanese language learning perspective】**

This book has an intimidating number of volumes, of which this one is just the first. The story moves at a relaxed 
pace and is more slice-of-life than I expected. It's a cute story even if it comes off as a little bit childish at
times. Even so, it doesn't stray away from using vocabulary and kanji that are a challenge from a Japanese learning 
perspective.

It's fun how it takes it's pre-industrial setting seriously describing the dirtiness and smellyness of the world
that our protagonist Main is not prepared for. 
I'm looking forward to continue reading later volumes to find out if the story embraces more of it's magical/isekai 
elements in, but for now I think I will put the rest of the series aside to continue later.
